Creating geographic maps with ggplot.

It is necessary to install R and the packages described in the .R file.

You have to save the map files (.csv, .shp, .shx, .prj, .dbf) in the current working directory.

The global administrative areas of the country of interest are available at [GADM](www.gadm.org).

In order to create a map with ggplot tools, you may download the geodata as shapefile format (not ESRI geodatabase, not .RData).
