### Purpose 
Create geographic maps with R ggplot2.

It is necessary to install R and the packages described in the .R file.

### Data 

The global administrative areas of the country of interest are available at [GADM](http://www.gadm.org).

In order to create a map with ggplot tools, you may download the geodata as shapefile format (not ESRI geodatabase, not .RData).

Save the geographic structure files (.csv, .shp, .shx, .prj, .dbf) in your current working directory.

### Example

A map of administrative level-1 divisions of Mexico is provided.
