Creating geographic maps with ggplot.

It is necessary to install R and the packages described in the .R file.

Save the geographic structure files (.csv, .shp, .shx, .prj, .dbf) in your current working directory.

The global administrative areas of the country of interest are available at [GADM](www.gadm.org).

In order to create a map with ggplot tools, you may download the geodata as shapefile format (not ESRI geodatabase, not .RData).
